Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. It looks at the items they like (usually based on rating) and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions. Similar users are those with similar rating and on the based on that they get recommendations. In content based, we look only at the item level, recommending on similar items sold. An example of collaborative filtering can be to predict the rating of a particular user based on his/her ratings for other movies and others\\u2019 ratings for all movies. This concept is widely used in recommending movies in IMDB, Netflix & BookMyShow, product recommenders in e-commerce sites like Amazon, eBay & Flipkart, YouTube video recommendations and game recommendations in Xbox\",\n          \"While Generative AI has made remarkable strides, it\\u2019s essential to acknowledge its \\nlimitations and challenges.

Here are some key constraints of Generative AI: \\n \\n\\u25cf Data Dependency: Generative AI models, including GANs, require vast amounts of \\ndata for training. Without sufficient data, the quality of generated content may suffer, \\nand the model might produce unrealistic or biassed results. \\n\\u25cf Ethical Concerns: Generative AI can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the \\ntraining data. This raises ethical concerns, particularly when it comes to generating \\ncontent related to sensitive topics, such as race, gender, or religion. \\n\\u25cf Lack of Control: Generative AI can be unpredictable. Controlling the output to meet \\nspecific criteria, especially in creative tasks, can be challenging. This lack of control \\ncan limit its practicality in some applications. \\n\\u25cf Resource Intensive: Training and running advanced Generative AI models demand \\nsubstantial computational resources, making them inaccessible to smaller \\norganisations or individuals with limited computing power. \\n\\u25cf Overfitting: Generative models may memorise the training data instead of learning its \\nunderlying patterns. This can result in content that lacks diversity and creativity. \\n\\u25cf Security Risks: There is the potential for malicious use of Generative AI, such as \\ngenerating deepfake videos for deceptive purposes or creating fake content to \\nspread misinformation. \\n\\u25cf Intellectual Property Concerns: When Generative AI is used to create content, \\ndetermining ownership and copyright becomes complex. This raises legal questions \\nabout intellectual property rights. \\n\\u25cf Validation Challenges: It can be difficult to validate the authenticity of content \\ngenerated by Generative AI, which can be problematic in contexts where trust and \\nreliability are paramount.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"catogory\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Statistics\",\n          \"Data Science\",\n          \"Miscellaneous\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. It looks at the items they like (usually based on rating) and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions. Similar users are those with similar rating and on the based on that they get recommendations. In content based, we look only at the item level, recommending on similar items sold. An example of collaborative filtering can be to predict the rating of a particular user based on his/her ratings for other movies and others\\u2019 ratings for all movies. This concept is widely used in recommending movies in IMDB, Netflix & BookMyShow, product recommenders in e-commerce sites like Amazon, eBay & Flipkart, YouTube video recommendations and game recommendations in Xbox\",\n          \"While Generative AI has made remarkable strides, it\\u2019s essential to acknowledge its \\nlimitations and challenges. Understanding these limitations is crucial for responsible and \\neffective use. Here are some key constraints of Generative AI: \\n \\n\\u25cf Data Dependency: Generative AI models, including GANs, require vast amounts of \\ndata for training. Without sufficient data, the quality of generated content may suffer, \\nand the model might produce unrealistic or biassed results. \\n\\u25cf Ethical Concerns: Generative AI can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the \\ntraining data. This raises ethical concerns, particularly when it comes to generating \\ncontent related to sensitive topics, such as race, gender, or religion. \\n\\u25cf Lack of Control: Generative AI can be unpredictable. Controlling the output to meet \\nspecific criteria, especially in creative tasks, can be challenging. This lack of control \\ncan limit its practicality in some applications. \\n\\u25cf Resource Intensive: Training and running advanced Generative AI models demand \\nsubstantial computational resources, making them inaccessible to smaller \\norganisations or individuals with limited computing power. \\n\\u25cf Overfitting: Generative models may memorise the training data instead of learning its \\nunderlying patterns. This can result in content that lacks diversity and creativity. \\n\\u25cf Security Risks: There is the potential for malicious use of Generative AI, such as \\ngenerating deepfake videos for deceptive purposes or creating fake content to \\nspread misinformation. \\n\\u25cf Intellectual Property Concerns: When Generative AI is used to create content, \\ndetermining ownership and copyright becomes complex. This raises legal questions \\nabout intellectual property rights. \\n\\u25cf Validation Challenges: It can be difficult to validate the authenticity of content \\ngenerated by Generative AI, which can be problematic in contexts where trust and \\nreliability are paramount.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
